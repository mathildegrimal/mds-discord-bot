# MyWonderFulBot,
## a wonderful bot for discord that says hello in multiple languages

### Technologies

The bot is built using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.
Good guide to understand how to code bots [here](https://discordjs.guide/)

### Installation

You can clone or fork this git repository but first you will have to set an application on your discord account and create a bot. See the first steps of this good guide to understand how to create bots [here](https://discordjs.guide/).

Then you will have to put a .env file a the root of your application with these variables :

```
CLIENT_ID=<your_app_client_id>
GUILD_ID=<your_server_id> // server in wich you want to use the bot
BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
```

### How to install the bot on your server

Just paste this link in your browser :
[MyWonderfulBot Link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=951392211700969524&permissions=2048&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

### How to talk with the bot

- Mention @MyWonderfulBot and it will send you a kind message to offer you help.
- Say "hello" (language you want between italian, spanish, deutch, english, french and chinese) and it will answer you ! But it is not smart enough to answer in the same language as you. It is often confused between egnlish and italian so...
- tape /random, and choose min and max : it will send you a random number between min and max, so you can play the lotto or wtf game you want


### How to reuse the project and personalize it
